    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      "Inception" is a science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The story follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in the art of extraction—stealing secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. He is given a chance to have his criminal history erased if he can accomplish the impossible: inception. Instead of stealing an idea, he must plant one. Cobb and his team of specialists must pull off the reverse heist of implanting an idea into a target's mind.
